For those of you who were using my old script to watch your daily writing progress in [Status Board](http://panic.com/statusboard/)—as I originally detailed [here](/post/61417560267/monitor-current-writing-progress-with-status-board)—that script broke in Mavericks. I finally updated it last night, and you can find the new code on the [Gist](https://gist.github.com/craigeley/6583530).

For those of you who missed it the first time, this script scans a specific folder of plain text writing files and then sends the title, word count, and time modified out to a HTML table that can be read by Status Board. I’m glad to have it back in operation.
