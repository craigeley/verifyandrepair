Two weeks ago, Stephen Wolfram posted the introductory video for Wolfram Language, the coding language that underlays all of Wolfram Alpha. The language appears to be a code-lover's dream—Brett Terpstra [called it "pornography"][1], and I tend to agree. It is incredibly exciting to see the ways that you can physically interact with the scripts and data via sliders, buttons, and other graphic elements.

But I was even more excited about something that wasn't discussed in the video: sound. One of the main modules for Wolfram Language is simply called "sound," and from a quick glance at some of the documentation it is clearly a powerful tool that could really advance digital humanities work in sound studies. There is this [overview of signal processing][2], and also tutorials like [analog filter design][3] and [digital filter design][4]. The ability to generate spectrograms [appears to be built-in][5] (!!).

After spending just 30 minutes with these online documents, I can't wait to see what is possible with this language—especially in the hands of people more capable of coding then I am.
