As you can tell from my [SIFTTTER projects](http://craigeley.com/tagged/sifttter), I’ve become borderline obsessed with activity tracking and logging. I’m still not entirely sure what drives this impulse, but I’m certainly not alone—new services and products to track this itch seem to pop up daily at this point.

The newest one I’ve seen is [Reporter](http://www.reporter-app.com/), a nifty little iPhone app that randomly polls you throughout the day to see what you’re up to. I’ve used it for a few days now, and in my opinion, the best things about these apps continues to be the way that that they can leverage your phone’s sensors to pull down information about your location, how many steps you’ve taken, etc. However, Reporter is the first app I’ve seen (though I’m sure there are others) that uses your phone’s microphone to track ambient noise levels. I’m worried that this will give the [moral noise police](http://craigeley.com/post/75482668793/after-seeing-this-new-film-trailer-im-pretty) more fuel for their fire, but it is actually kind of cool. I’m thinking of using the app just for this purpose, especially because you can easily export the data.

While [Liz](https://twitter.com/elizwyckoff) was out of town last weekend I spent some time working my own scripts for daily tracking, which I’ll post about later in the week.
