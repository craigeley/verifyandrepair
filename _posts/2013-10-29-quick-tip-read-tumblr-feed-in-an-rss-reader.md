If you have $10 to spare and like RSS reading, this little workflow has helped me more fully integrate Tumblr into my day. While it sacrifices ‘likes’ and ‘reblogs,’ I think it makes up for it in formatting and convenience. Now I read Tumblr posts alongside the other RSS feeds that I check on every day—ranging from [Mac Rumors](http://www.macrumors.com/) to [new job listings](http://academicjobs.wikia.com/wiki/American_Studies_2014).

Things needed: [IFTTT account](https://ifttt.com/) (like Dropbox, a service I can no longer live without, and is free); a [Feedly account](http://www.feedly.com/) (also free), and [ReadKit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/readkit/id588726889?ls=1&mt=12) ($7). You can also use any RSS reader of your choice that integrates with Feedly.

Steps:

1.  Set up an IFTTT recipe that pushes new Tumblr posts to Feedly. [This one](https://ifttt.com/recipes/99715) will do the trick.

2.  Set up a smart folder in ReadKit that pulls in your Tumblr feed. Here is how mine is configured:

That’s all there is to it.
