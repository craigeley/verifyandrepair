### My Logging Workflow 2016

I remember the first script I ever saw: [a way to log TaskPaper files to Day One](https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/1913007) posted by [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/2012/02/25/automating-taskpaper-to-day-one-logs/). A year or two earlier I had discovered Markdown, and eventuially that led me to Day One, etc.

I'm not a coder. I'm self-taught at best, so there are probably better ways to do this.
