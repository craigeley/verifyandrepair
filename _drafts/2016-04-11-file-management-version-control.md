I’ve spent a ton of time over the last several years tweaking the hows and whys of the writing I do 

### Markdown

Everything I write I write in [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). It’s just insanely fast, insanely extensible and customizable. There is nothing that it can’t do. Because I didn’t do a great job documenting.[^It can do footnotes.]

{>>It can do critic markup comments<<}. And it can do [inline links](http://verifyandrepair.com), which is pretty much all I need from my editor.
