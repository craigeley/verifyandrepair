*"Server Nerdery" is a series about workflows designed for an always-on computer or home server.*

A few years ago, I started using a Mac Mini as a media server. But soon I become intersted in what else that little box could do while it was sitting there. So I started tinkering with [Sinatra](!g "sinatra ruby server"), an amazingly robust little program that can, among other things, read incoming [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook).

This allows you to parse data from web services that offer webhooks, and one of the most robust is GitHub.

While working on my current writing worflow posts, I also took some time to revisit my task management workflow.

I'm really inclined for a calendar layout, which is why I still like BusyCal so much — I can see all of my tasks and reminders in a nice calendar interface, but the killer feature for pure ease of use is the ability to drag and drop to change the due dates. Doesn't get much easier than that.

At the same time, I've dallied in Trello, and think that the "card" interface has some real niceties, including the ability to create comments and subtasks.
