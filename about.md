I’m a tinkerer. As I’ve moved in and around academia, music, and radio production for the last few years—when things seemed super bleak, then super awesome, then bleak again, then repeat—I’ve always been able to find a significant amount of pleasure and solitude in tinkering with workflows, computer software and the code that underlies all of that.
I don’t really do “DH,” nor do I really know how to code, exactly. If it needs a name, I think it’s about workflow.
